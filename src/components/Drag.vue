    <h2>MEMBERSHIP 2019-2020</h2>
    <p>Membership of the playroom is only available to families in Hillman, East River and Amalgamated Co-ops.
    The annual fee is $200 for the membership year: November 1, 2019 - October 31, 2020. Those joining in the months after will pay a pro-rated membership fee with payment in full at time of joining.
    Those families living in the Amalgamated and East River Co-ops will also have to pay a $25 deposit for a key fob they will receive to enter the building.</p>
    <h3> What does my membership money go towards?</h3>
    <p>At this time 100% of membership fees go to the cleaning of the room (currently covers 65% of annual cleaning fees). We want to continue to support a private cleaner 5 times a week, which keeps our space in the best condition for our children and community members. This is one of the highest priorities of the committee - to maintain a clean and sanitary room.
    Private rental income covers the rest of the cleaning fees, and any additional money is put back into the room for improvements.</p>
   <h3> Why payment in full?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, we don't have the technology or the man-power to manage a membership which receives payments monthly at this time.</p>
